			New York Based, AEA Actor
			</p>	
			

			<p class="paragraph-text about-text">Tara has most notably appeared in The Mysteries at the Flea Theater where she played a series of increasingly distressed biblical women, and Kapow-i Gogo at the People’s Inprov Theater where she wore antlers and puppeteered cardboard cutouts with the gusto of an anime character. 
			</p>

			<p class="paragraph-text about-text">Tara currently trains at the UCB, Kimball Studio, and with Blessed Unrest - a company that specializes in international collaboration and devised physical theater. </p>

			<p class="paragraph-text about-text">In her free time Tara tinkers with web design, is aggressively snuggly with her cat, and is fighting the uphill battle of “becoming a runner”. Also, one time, Billy Porter held her face and told her she was funny -she's never letting that go.</p>
